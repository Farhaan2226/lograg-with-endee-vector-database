LogRAG is a local, secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that helps engineers understand, diagnose, and resolve production issues by analyzing historical logs and generating structured explanations using a local Large Language Model (LLM).

The system is designed to remain partially functional even when the LLM backend is unavailable, making it resilient and production-aware.

🚀 Key Features

🔍 Semantic Log Search using vector embeddings

🧠 LLM-powered log explanation (local, private)

🛡️ Prompt-injection resistant by design

🧩 Graceful degradation when LLM is unavailable

📊 Streamlit UI for interactive analysis

🐳 Dockerized backend for reproducibility

🧪 Synthetic + real log ingestion support
